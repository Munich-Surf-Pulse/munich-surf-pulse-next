# Munich Surf Pulse Next

## Features

- **Real-Time Occupancy Data:** See how crowded each surf spot is based on live reports from fellow surfers.
- **Crowdsourced Contributions:** Submit your own occupancy reports after your surf session to help others in the community.
- **Surf Spot Information:** Get details on popular surf spots in Munich, including current conditions and user ratings.
- **Historical Trends:** Analyze crowd patterns over time to find the best times to surf.
- **Community Engagement:** Connect with other surfers, share tips, and coordinate meet-ups.
